# <ins>***SHEPHERD***</ins>: An Automated AI Livestock Health Monitoring System

## About
SHEPHERD is the AI Livestock Health Monitoring System that helps local farmers to monitor their livestock 24/7 and warns them of any potential health problems. Think of a "Fitbit", but for sheep. Instead of equipping each sheep with their own expensive and annoying monitor, we can leverage AI and preexisting camera systems to devliver a simple and cost-effective software solution to sheep farmers. Like humans, when sheep are feeling ill, they tend not to move much. SHEPHERD uses a special custom tracking algorithm to monitor the animals, track the distance they have moved, and warns the farmers if a particular sheep hasn't been active. SHEPHERD can detect the early warning signs of illness and flag those individual sheep at the most risk, saving farmers time and money and keeping our sheep healthy and happy!

SHEPHERD won 1st place in the Midwest AI Challenge: The Social Impact Big Data Quest.

The research powering SHEPHERD was presented at ABRCMS Conference 2024. See the poster presentation at https://lequ02.github.io/shepherd/ABRCMS_POSTER.pdf
